1. For the Portal Application OmniScript, add additional processing logic to send separate Location form packets for any more than 1 new Facilities added. 
2. The DocuSign template setup is pending
3. The template should be called for each new facility that is added except the 1st facility as 1st (or any one) of the facility is already covered as part of the main application packet.
4. Create a new Custom Object: DocuSign Packet Details (DocuSignPacketDetails__c)
- CaseId Lookup to Case object (Application case id)
- Other fields: use the same fields that we introduced to capture EnvelopeId, Status, dates etc. from Case object to this new object
5. Modify the DocuSign batch jobs that are depended on the existing Case object and fields to this new Custom Object DocuSignPacketDetails__c
6. Validate all DocuSign functionalities works as expected including generating separate Location form packets if any

*TASK ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA*
 # *Navigation from Application Case:*
 ## When viewing an Application case, the breadcrumb menu should allow the user to navigate back to the “My Applications” table.
 # *Navigation from Recredentialing Case:*
 ## When viewing a Recredentialing case, the breadcrumb menu should allow the user to navigate back to the “My Recredentialing Cases” table.
 # *Navigation from Credentialing Termination Case:*
 ## When viewing a Credentialing case, the breadcrumb menu should allow the user to navigate back to the “My Credentialing Termination Cases” table.
 # *Navigation from Appeal Case:*
 ## If a user opened an Appeal case from a Recredentialing case, the breadcrumb menu should allow the user to navigate back to the parent Recredentialing case.
 ## If a user opened an Appeal case from an Application case, the breadcrumb menu should allow the user to navigate back to the parent Application case.
 ## If a user opened an Appeal case from a Credentialing Termination case, the breadcrumb menu should allow the user to navigate back to the parent Credentialing case.
 ## If a user opened an Appeal case from the “My Appeal Cases” table, the breadcrumb menu should allow the user to navigate back to the “My Appeal Cases” table.

*Additional Notes:*
 * The implementation should be placed in the upper left corner of the page.
 * The breadcrumb menu should dynamically update based on the user's navigation path.
 * The breadcrumb menu should be intuitive and clearly indicate the hierarchy of navigation.

*Technical Notes:*

Depending on state or letter specific requirements, a letter might need to be sent via the UPS signature process, rather than by standard mail. When constructing the print file name, Salesforce must indicate what method (standard or UPS Signature) should be used to send the letter. This will be controlled via the first element in the print file name. When sending standard, the first element in the print file name should read “DNMPX”. If you are wanting to send the letter via UPS signature, you should instead use “DNMPXC”.

_Standard =_ DNMPX

_UPS Signature =_ DNMPXC

*Print File Name Examples*

*Technical Notes:*

 We will be using standard Case Management for this, and the ""Internal Process"" record type will be the driver for it.

Create new Case Reason picklist value named ""Reports & Dashboards"" and assign it to Internal Case record type.
If support process doesnt exist for this record type, make one with the values New, In Progress, Closed.

Create a global action labeled ""Internal Case"" that should open the page to create a case with the Internal Process record type.
The global action ""form"" should show the reason (with only the ""Reports & Dashboards"" value) and description fields required for the user to populate. 
All the rest of the fields described in the Solution Overview should be pre-populated by default (using predefined field values).

The global action should be available for all users when they press the ""+"" Icon that is on the top right section of the screen in Salesforce.

 Create a record triggered flow that will run when a Task is updated. The logic inside the flow should be that if the task's status changed to Completed and the current user is NOT the user that originally created the task, then a chatter post is created ""at mentioning"" the creator that the task has been completed.
If that's not possible, consider creating a notification as explained here: https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=sf.flow_ref_elements_actions_sendcustomnotification.htm&type=5

*Technical Notes:*
1. Create a new BRE ""Fee Schedule Assignments"" for the data set of ""NonHeartland_TD_DefaultFs"" sheet with the following fields
DSO Name
ZipCode
-State-
-City-
GP FS
SP FS
Note: for DSO Name field, set ""Common"" as the value for all rows
 
-2. Add default FS entry- 
-DSO Name = Common-
-ZipCode = NULL-
-State = NULL-
-City = NULL-
-GP Fee Schedule = TBD (confirm with business)-
-SP Fee Schedule = TBD (confirm with business)-
 
3. Create another new BRE ""DSO Specific Fee Schedule Assignments"" for the data set of ""Heartland_TD_DefaultFs"" sheet with the following fields
DSO Name
ZipCode
-State-
-City-
Fee Schedule
Note: for DSO Name field, set ""Heartland Dental"" as the value for all rows. Confirm the DSO account name with business
 
-4. Add default FS entry- 
-DSO Name = Heartland Dental-
-ZipCode = NULL-
-State = NULL-
-City = NULL-
-FS = TBD (confirm with business)-
 
5. Create a new Custom Metadata to configure the ""DSOs Specific FS Assignment"".
Note: for now only ""Heartland Dental"" record will be configured. If tomorrow a new DSO wants their own specific FS, then we will add an entry here along with adding records in ""DSO Specific Fee Schedule Assignments"" BRE.
 
6. Perform the FS assignments in the same order as per AC
i. Check for an active HFN (affiliation) for the same Facility and pick the HealthcareFacilityNetwork.FeeScheduleDefinition__c, if found use this FS for the HFN records that are getting created.
ii. If not found from above, check the DSO name exists in metadata ""DSOs Specific FS Assignment""
 - if DSO found use ""DSO Specific Fee Schedule Assignments"" BRE to fetch FS assignment
 - Input is ""Zipcode"" value (3 digit or 5 digit based on requirement), output is ""Fee Schedule"" value
 - -If no record matches, use Default FS record-
 - else use ""Fee Schedule Assignments"" BRE to fetch FS assignment
 - Input is ""Zipcode"" value (3 digit or 5 digit based on requirement), output is ""GP Fee Schedule"" & ""SP Fee Schedule"" value
 - -If no record matches, use Default FS record-
 - Use ""GP Fee Schedule"" or ""SP Fee Schedule"" depending on Specialty
 
7. For the FS, use the FS Salesforce Id
 
8. Use these BRE's, Metadata in the DSO import process for HFN creation and assign the correct FS Id
 
9. Validate the functionality works as expected

Refer SFDC-44590 for the base Flexcards creation
1. Build the ""DSOImportFileCard"" & ""DSOImportAddFileCard"" flexcards in details as per requirement / UI AC
2. For ""DSOImportFileCard"" flexcard
 - Extract data from STG_DSO_Integration__c object for the same DSO account
 - Status__c != Complete
 - DISTINCT of RecordTypeId (Add), FileTracker__c for the same DSO Account
 - ORDER BY CreatedDate DESC
Note: the 1st row will be preselected (no other selections allowed)
3. For ""DSOImportAddFileCard"" flexcard
 - Extract all data from STG_DSO_Integration__c object for the same DSO account, for the file selected from the previous screen
 - Status__c != Complete
 - ORDER BY StdConfidenceLevel__c DESC
Note: Display 100 records per page (make this as a config setting)
4. All records (line items) will have a checkbox for Load and pre-selected based on Load__c
5. All records (line items) will have a checkbox for Use suggested Physical Address? & pre-selected based on UseStdPhysicalAddress__c
6. On Submit, make updates to records based on selections for Load_{_}c & UseStdPhysicalAddress{_}_c
7. Validate the UI, extraction, display of data, updates are working as expected

You can find example versions of the documents and the language in the body here: Email_Appeal Approval Break in Coverage
The following fonts should be utilized in the email body:
DMX: Century Gothic
DNOA/Blues: Ariel

1. Configure 2 records via Setup -> Organization-Wide Email Addresses
Note: use the test email ids for lower environments, and add a PD step to update the emails for PROD deployment
For DNOA/BCBS
Display Name: DNOARecredentialing
Email Address: recredentialing@dnoa.com
Allowed Profiles: All
For DMX
Display Name: DMXRecredentialing
Email Address: recredentialing@dentemax.com
Allowed Profiles: All

2. Add 2 or 7 new Lightning Email templates (For DNOA/Blues, it we can handle logo's dynamic then 1 template, otherwise 6 templates)
DNOA-Blues Recredentialing Appeal Approval - Break in Coverage Email Template
DMX Recredentialing Appeal Approval - Break in Coverage Email Template

If we cannot control the logo dynamic for DNOA/BCBSxx, then these are the names for DNOA & Blues
DNOA Recredentialing Appeal Approval - Break in Coverage Email Template
BSBCIL Recredentialing Appeal Approval - Break in Coverage Email Template
BSBCNM Recredentialing Appeal Approval - Break in Coverage Email Template
BSBCTX Recredentialing Appeal Approval - Break in Coverage Email Template
BSBCMT Recredentialing Appeal Approval - Break in Coverage Email Template
BSBCOK Recredentialing Appeal Approval - Break in Coverage Email Template

3. Base object for both these templates is Case

4. Effective Date source is from HFN's Effective Date

5. Use the content/logo for the template from the above ""Email_Appeal Approval Break in Coverage""

6. Use the existing Flow of the actual Email Action that accepts Template Id/Name, Network, any other inputs needed for the Flow
Use this query to fetch the From Email Id based on Input, e.g.
SELECT Id, Address, DisplayName FROM OrgWideEmailAddress WHERE DisplayName='DNOARecredentialing'

7. Use existing Flow as sub flow with in Recredentialing Case flow and based on the business criteria, call this new Flow
Criteria:
Recordtype = Appeal (and its Parent Case's recordtype is Recredentialing)
Type = Recredentialing
Status IS CHANGING AND Status = ""Closed""
OGMDecision__c = ""Approved""
The corresponding HFN's Effective to is in PAST (IMP/CAUTION: make sure this process runs before creating a new set of HFN's and refer the old set of records)

8. Validate the emails are working properly based on Network and Types

*Technical Notes:*

 Create the corresponding Salesforce Lightning Templates if they haven't been created yet. If they already exist, then update them accordingly. Need to have one template for each of the sub reasons, network and ""entity"" (organization or provider) combinations.
Example: ""Info TIN Change - DMX - Provider""
Take into account that for the organization templates you need to user the Organization Contact field

Update the logic in Omniscript ""PNM_SupportCaseCreation"" so that the right templates are being used when the Reason is ""Provide Instructions/Info"" and the sub-reason are the ones described in the Solution Overview. For subreason = ""TIN Change"" also display an additional dropdown with the State options listed in the Solution overview.
Use the template named ""Change Instructions Email.docx"" for the sub-reasons TIN Change, Provider Changes, and Specialty.
For Voluntary Term Request use the template named ""Provider Termination Request Email.docx""

NOTE: Make sure that the FROM email is the correct one as described in each of the templates.

Rename the attachments to make them unique as follows:
 * DNoA_Ownership-TaxIDChange_Generic_TN.pdf => TINCHANGEDNOATN.pdf

Upload the attachments into Files => Libraries => Document Templates

Create the following org wide email addresses (if it's not already created):
 * For dmxdatainquiry@dentemax.com:
 ** Display Name: DenteMax Provider Relations
 ** Email Address: [your dearborn's email address as of now]
 ** Purpose: User Selection
 ** Allow All Profiles to User this From Address
 * For dnoadentalproviderfees@dnoa.com:
 ** Display Name: DNoA Provider Relations
 ** Email Address: [your dearborn's email address as of now]
 ** Purpose: User Selection
 ** Allow All Profiles to User this From Address
 * For enrollment@dentemax.com:
 ** Display Name: DenteMax Provider Administration
 ** Email Address: [your dearborn's email address as of now]
 ** Purpose: User Selection
 ** Allow All Profiles to User this From Address
 * For dnoa_pa_notification@dnoa.com:
 ** Display Name: DNoA Provider Administration
 ** Email Address: [your dearborn's email address as of now]
 ** Purpose: User Selection
 ** Allow All Profiles to User this From Address

Make sure to validate those OWEA.

Update the logic in the corresponding OS so that you populate the FROM addresses based on the organization wide email addresses created above. This means that you will need to retrieve those email addresses querying the OrgWideEmailAddress object, and then those are assigned to the Email Action FROM field with a merge field (e.g: %OrgEmail:Address%)

Update the logic so that when is subreason = TIN the corresponding attachment is included (based on network and state). Use also a merge field on the Email Action Attachment List property

 * The following fonts should be utilized in the email body:
 ** DMX: Century Gothic
 ** DNOA/Blues: Ariel

1. If these are not configured before, then configure 2 records via Setup -> Organization-Wide Email Addresses
Note: use the test email ids for lower environments, and add a PD step to update the emails for PROD deployment
For DNOA/BCBS
Display Name: DNOACredentialing
Email Address: recredentialing@dnoa.com
Allowed Profiles: All
For DMX
Display Name: DMXCredentialing
Email Address: recredentialing@dentemax.com
Allowed Profiles: All

2. Add 2 or 7 new Lightning Email templates (For DNOA/Blues, if we can handle logo's dynamic then 1 template, otherwise 6 templates)
DNOA-Blues Recredentialing App Complete Email Template
DMX Recredentialing App Complete Email Template

If we cannot control the logo dynamic for DNOA/BCBSxx, then these are the names for DNOA & Blues
DNOA Recredentialing App Complete Email Template
BSBCIL Recredentialing App Complete Email Template
BSBCNM Recredentialing App Complete Email Template
BSBCTX Recredentialing App Complete Email Template
BSBCMT Recredentialing App Complete Email Template
BSBCOK Recredentialing App Complete Email Template

3. Base object for both these templates is Case

4. Use the content/logo for the template from the above ""[Email_Recred App Complete|https://myfyi.sharepoint.com/:f:/r/teams/DNITPMO1/Projects/Provider%20Network%20Management/Shared%20Documents/02%20Planning%20Artifacts/Forms/Email%20Templates/Approved%20Email%20Templates/Email_Recred%20App%20Complete?csf=1&web=1&e=sRjXZL]""

5. Use the existing Flow of the actual Email Action that accepts Template Id/Name, Network, any other inputs needed for the Flow
Use this query to fetch the From Email Id based on Input, e.g.
SELECT Id, Address, DisplayName FROM OrgWideEmailAddress WHERE DisplayName='DNOARecredentialing'

6. Use existing Flow as sub flow with in Recredentialing Case flow and based on the business criteria, call this new Flow
Criteria:
 - Recordtype = Recredentialing
 - Status IS CHANGING AND Status = ""Ready for CVO""

7. Validate the emails are working properly based on Network and Types

Refer SFDC-39713 as similar Step is built 
1. Use OS PNM/ProviderReCredentialingApplication, and build the UI as per AC (refer SFDC-39713 to reuse the Professional Questions Step)
2. Make necessary changes to Professional Questions step, for each question when ""Yes"" is selected a new Comments box below the question to be displayed and a mandatory response is needed
3. Entered comments needs to be saved against the same question below the the question response in the JSON field
4. Validate the UI is working as expected in displaying the comments box when ""Yes"" is selected and save comments properly. Also validate the entered comments are re-displayed again on UI in the Professional Step

 # The AC references ""Provider Date"" records, but the actual name of the object utilized is ""Provider Date Config."" This is expected/acceptable for the functional AC. 

{color:#0747a6}*____________________________________________________________*{color}

*Technical Notes:*

1. Create a new custom object ""Provider Date Config""  (ProviderDateConfig__c) with the following fields:
 - Provider (Provider__c Lookup to Person Account Record Id)
 - State Code (StateCode__c Picklist)
 - Network (Network__c Lookup to Payer Account) 
 - ReCred Due Date (ReCredDueDate__c Date)
 - Active (Active__c checkbox)

 

2. Add new configuration record for ""Recred Due Date"" to Effective Date rules metadata similar to ""Appeal Window End Date""
 - Type = Recred Due Date
 - Output Add Days = 1065
 - all other values same as ""Appeal Window End Date""

 

3. Credential Application: Per AC #1 or AC #2, when application is approved, look for an entry in ProviderDateConfig__c object for the same Provider, same State, same Network
If does not exists, create a record in ProviderDateConfig__c object
 - Provider__c = Provider Person Account Id
 - StateCode__c = same State as the application is for
 - Network__c = AccountId of the Payer Account) 
 - ** ReCredDueDate__c = Approval date (current date) + 1065 days (based on configuration from point #2 above, do not hardcode)
 - Active = true
Note: 
i. For States other than KY/NM, if there is already any record exists for the same Provider in ProviderDateConfig_{_}c object, use the same date for ReCredDueDate{_}_c field (DO NOT DETERMINE BASED ON CONFIGURATION)
ii. For States KY/NM, calculate the date always
iii. Need to configure this logic instead of hardcode, so that we should be able to adjust(add/remove) State based on business requirements.
If exists, no action

 

4. ReCredential Application: Per AC #3, when a recred app is approved, update ProviderDateConfig_{_}c.ReCredDueDate{_}_c field for the same Provider, same State, same Network
Note: 
i. For States other than KY/NM, update all records for the same Provider in ProviderDateConfig__c object with the new date as per configuration
ii. For States KY/NM, it will be a separate 1 record itself (update this particular record only)
iii. Need to configure this logic instead of hardcode, so that we should be able to adjust(add/remove) State based on business requirements.

 

5. Component named ""Recredentialing Cycle"", to show only records that are Active (true)

 

6. Validate implementation works as per requirement

*Testing Notes:*
 # The AC references ""Provider Date"" records, but the actual name of the object utilized is ""Provider Date Config."" This is expected/acceptable for the functional AC. 
 # In addition to the Recredentialing case, Developer/Sys Admin users will also observe that a Group Recredentialing case is created as part of the processes noted in the AC. This is expected behavior, but references to the Group Recredentialing case are intentionally left out of the AC because that case record is only visible to Developers/Sys Admins. 
 # QA team members will need to update Provider Date Config records from the backend in order to test this story appropriately. 

{color:#0747a6}*____________________________________________________________*{color}

*Technical Notes:*

1. Add new configuration record for ""ReCred Case Creation"" to Effective Date rules metadata similar to ""Appeal Window End Date""
 - Type = ReCred Case Creation
 - Output Add Days = 91
 - all other values same as ""Appeal Window End Date""

2. Create a new RecordType ""Group Recredentialing"" or refer SFDC-42969

3. Create a Scheduled Flow that runs each day (timing 2am CST) 
 - Fetch all ACTIVE records from ProviderDateConfig_{_}c object where Active = true AND the ReCredDueDate{_}_c = Current date + Fetch ""ReCred Case Creation"" days from configuration.

i. For each Provider, create ""Group Recredentialing"" case with the following values
RecordType = Group Recredentialing
AccountId = Provider Person Account Id
Type = On Cycle 
Status = New

ii. For each record of the Provider (combination of Provider, State, Network), create a Recredentialing Case and set the following fields
RecordType = Recredentialing
AccountId = Provider Person Account Id
Type = On Cycle 
Business License = Active license record associated with the same State
Network = same Network
Status = New
Owner = Credentialing Queue
Due Date = 3 months away from today (TODAY + 91 days) (use the same ""ReCred Case Creation"" days from configuration)
ParentId = Record Id of ""Group Recredentialing"" created above
IMP: refer SFDC-41041 to see any additional field that are important needs to be included as well

4. Validate the batch executes and creates Group Recredentialing & Recredentialing cases as per requirement

 * The following fonts should be utilized in the email body:
 ** DMX: Century Gothic
 ** DNOA/Blues: Ariel

1. If these are not configured before, then configure 2 records via Setup -> Organization-Wide Email Addresses
Note: use the test email ids for lower environments, and add a PD step to update the emails for PROD deployment

Display Name: DNOACredentialing
Email Address: recredentialing@dnoa.com
Allowed Profiles: All
For DMX
Display Name: DMXCredentialing
Email Address: recredentialing@dentemax.com
Allowed Profiles: All

2. Add 2 or 7 new Lightning Email templates (For DNOA/Blues, if we can handle logo's dynamic then 1 template, otherwise 6 templates)
DNOA-Blues Recredentialing Acknowledgement Email Template
DMX Recredentialing Acknowledgement Email Template

If we cannot control the logo dynamic for DNOA/BCBSxx, then these are the names for DNOA & Blues

Termination - Term Date Logic - Phase 4 States,SFDC-39136,2931620,Story,To Do,SFDC,Markets Salesforce {PRD00000241},software,I359351,PRD00000241,,Lowest,,U533387,U533387,U533387,02/Aug/23 2:39 PM,17/Jul/24 1:34 PM,24/Sep/24 10:48 AM,,,SF DB PNMREL4,,,KaryEarehart-Seach,sfdc_pnm_team1b,,,,,"As a Network Support or Retention user I need termination dates to contain logic in accordance with regulations so that I can enter conforming termination dates.

 

*Open Questions:*
 * When it is something different than the end of month (i.e: 30 days), is it x days from today, from the end of month, requested date or from another date?
 * Can the termination date be in the past?
 * Is it ""at least x days""? or is exactly x days?
 * In the text most says ""without a cause"". Does it mean that if there are particular termination reasons that override that?
 * If a provider or practice works on more than 1 state, which one is considered?
 * Is ""x days"" = calendar days, business days, it depends?

 

*Solution Overview:*

In termination omniscript for Organization, Facility, and Provider make a new user input for ""Notification Date""
 * Notification date is a date picker and value can be a past value
 * Notification date is required and is dependent on Termination Type and will only be displayed when Termination Type = Voluntary

After user enters Notification Date, the termination date is autofilled

User can change the autofilled value in Termination Date subject to requirements by state

*Standard Termination Date Logic*

*Voluntary Termination*

Termination date will be autofilled as the LAST DAY of the month closest to 90 calendar days out, but not to exceed 90 calendar days from date entered in Notification Date. 

Example: Notification Date is July 20th. Termination Date Autofill would be September 30th (72 calendar days).

*Involuntary Termination*

Do not display notification date when Termination Type = Involuntary

Autofill the Termination Date with the last day of the current month.

Example: User launches action on July 20th, termination date autofill would be July 31st.

*State Specific Logic (Voluntary Termination Only):*

Rhode Island:
 * If Organization, Facility, or Provider being terminated is in Rhode Island (RI) AND termination reason = 'Voluntary - Contractual' then termination date is 15 days after date entered in Notification Date field on omniscript
 * User cannot change the termination date to a date more than 15 calendar days from date in Notification Date field

Hawaii: 
 * User cannot change termination date to a date less than 60 calendar days from date in Notification Date field

North Dakota:
 * User cannot change termination date to a date less than 60 calendar days from date in Notification Date field

South Dakota:
 * User cannot change termination date to a date less than 60 calendar days from date in Notification Date field

 # How do we capture the reason a provider didn't meet URAC requirements and pull that value into the letter?
 # There is a scenario where a provider may be denied and didn't meet URAC eligibility requirements. That provider appeals and their appeal is approved. They receive the Appeal Approval letter that notes that they will be submitted to the off-cycle recredentialing process. If after recredentialing, their URAC eligibility status changes and they are now eligible, that is not communicated today. There is a potential opportunity to improve the Recred Success letter with more info about the URAC review process. This is a business question.

Note: The list views and ""Mass Approve"" button already impkemented earlier
1. Use the current FlexCard/Flow which displays the message 
2. Based on user action, for the selected cases update the following fields
 - Status = ""Closed""
 - OGMDecision__c = ""Approved""
 - OGMDecisionBy__c = ""Dental Director""
3. Validate the functionality
Note: some of the rules that we check needs to be revisited to make sure it works as per the latest AC

 

*Testing Notes:*
 # ""Mass Approve"" button is seen on other list views too in addition to the one mentioned. A user will get the error message as mentioned if the required conditions are not satisfied.
 # ""Click ""Submit"" to move \{# of selected cases} to Approved."" has been slightly modified to read as: ""Click ""Submit"" to move \{# of selected cases} selected case(s) to Approved.""
 # From the page, I am able to select ""Cancel"" to exit the process and prevent the applications from being mass updated. - This has not been executed at present as this feature is not readily available in Flow & will require additional efforts – to be taken up later.

Let me know if you have any questions! 

CC: [~U512185] ;;;","06/May/24 2:05 PM;U512507;[~U512185] - SFDC-38075 is ready for review! This is a story that Amitabh began work on. Please note that the Dental Directors requested that we expand/adjust this functionality. I've noted the original AC that Amitabh implemented below for reference. From a high-level, this is what has changed:
 # The new list views are no longer needed because DDs want to be able to make the Approve/Term/Deny decision while the case is assigned to a queue. 
 # The ""Mass Approve"" functionality should be available on all list views with cases owned by the DD queue. 

 

*Scenario #1: Addition of new recred list views*

GIVEN that I am a Dental Director

WHEN I navigate to the Cases tab

THEN... 
 # I see a list view named ""My Open Recred Cases: 0"" that displays all open Application cases I own with a CVO Exception Category score of 0. I see the list view has the following columns:
 ## Case Number
 ## Subject
 ## Type
 ## Account
 ## Status
 ## CVO Exception Category
 ## Date/Time Opened
 # I see a list view named ""My Open Recred Cases: 1"" that displays all open Application cases I own with a CVO Exception Category score of 1. I see the list view has the following columns:
 ## Case Number
 ## Subject
 ## Type
 ## Account
 ## Status
 ## CVO Exception Category
 ## Date/Time Opened

 

*Scenario #2: Mass Approve Recredentialing Applications*

GIVEN that I am a Dental Director

AND I navigate to the Cases tab

WHEN I view the ""My Open Recred Cases: 0"" OR ""My Open Recred Cases: 1"" list view

THEN... 
 # I see a button named ""Mass Approve.""
 # I am able select specific and/or all cases via checkboxes. 
 # After I select the cases I want to mass update and I click the ""Mass Approve"" button, I am presented with a new console tab that displays the following message:
 ## Click ""Submit"" to move \{# of selected cases} to Approved. 
 # From the page, I am able to select ""Cancel"" to exit the process and prevent the applications from being mass updated. 
 # From the page, I am able to select ""Submit"" which initiates the following automated actions:
 ## The selected case is updated to ""Closed.""
 ## The Decision field on the case is updated to ""Approved.""
 ## The Decided By field on the case is updated to ""Dental Director.""

 

*Scenario #3: Attempt to utilize mass approval on cases that do not meet critiera*

GIVEN that I am a Dental Director

AND I navigate to the Cases tab

WHEN I launch the ""Mass Approve"" process
 # I see that I am only permitted to mass approve cases that meet the criteria below:
 ## Record Type = Recredentialing 
 ## Is Closed = False
 # I see that if I attempt to mass approve cases that do not meet the criteria, I encounter the error noted below:
 ## Please review your selected case(s). Only open recredentialing cases can be mass approved. 

 

*Scenario #4 Attempt to utilize mass approval as a non-Dental Director user*

GIVEN that I am NOT a Dental Director

AND I navigate to the Cases tab

WHEN I launch the ""Mass Approve"" process
 # I see that I encounter the error noted below:
 ## You are not permitted to use this action. Please close this tab. ;;;","24/May/24 4:22 PM;U512507;[~U531504] - Reassigning SFDC-38075 to you! Please note that the Dental Directors requested some updates to the Acceptance Criteria. Notable updates include:
 * Conditions where the Dental Director can and cannot use the Mass Approve button. See scenario 2. 
 * Stamping the Dental Director's name into the Dental Director lookup field on the case record. See scenario 1 — point 5.2.

 

Can you please make the necessary adjustments? Thank you!

Per feedback from the developer, this functionality will take more time than anticipated to implement and he wouldn't have it completed by the sprint's end. In order to make progress, I have removed that item and our team will take it up as a task in the next sprint. Please let me know if you have any questions/concerns.
